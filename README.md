# CS260 Startup
Is your mom or wife always wondering what she should make for dinner for the family? Or better yet, maybe you are 
always wondering what you should make for dinner for yourself or family? This app will be designed to solve that problem.
It will allow you to view and like recipes and then from there get recommendations on what you should cook if you can't 
decide for yourself. Along with that, you will be able to get cooking advice or just advice on good meals from other users who are also using the app. With this app, deciding what to cook should become a breeze.

# Things I've Learned
It is really helpful to understand how the HTML elements all stack and nest within each other. It makes it so much easier to format. 
Also, the debugger on the brower has been really helpful in finding out why the CSS didn't apply in the way I thought it would. 
In order to find out how to use bootstrap, you have to search it just like any other code. Once on bootstrap's website, inspect it so see what they used to build what you are looking for.
